### Changing Stream Data
The data being streamed can be changed by altering the `subscriptions` array within the `cs_bn/src/stream-funs/index.ts` TypeScript file. For further information on how to configure the different subscriptions visit the [CryptoWatch Web-socket documentation](https://docs.cryptowat.ch/websocket-api/data-subscriptions/trades).
